# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- Added tabs within workspaces, so a single workspace can now hold multiple terminal tab contexts with their own pane layouts.
- Added optional direct pane-focus keybindings for terminal mode, so you can switch panes with modifier shortcuts like `alt+h` or `alt+right` without entering navigate mode first.
- Added built-in direct integrations for pi, claude code, codex, and opencode, with install/uninstall commands under `herdr integration ...`.
- Added authoritative hook-driven state reporting support, so pane state can be updated directly from agent integrations instead of relying only on heuristics.

### Changed
- Refactored keybind discoverability so the in-app keybind help now shows all supported actions, including optional bindings that are currently unset.
- Keybind help now uses a centered scrollable modal with mouse and keyboard scrolling, matching the release-notes interaction model more closely.
- Popups and action-button interactions were refactored to use more consistent modal geometry and button semantics across the ui.

### Documentation
- Updated the README, configuration guide, and socket api docs to reflect tabs, unset optional keybindings, direct terminal-mode navigation examples, and the current workspace-scoped pane id model.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- Fixed a macOS-only startup misdetection where pi could briefly appear as codex in the sidebar because process environment entries were being parsed as command-line arguments.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-31

### Changed
- Mouse wheel handling now follows the tmux/Ghostty model more closely: fullscreen apps receive wheel input when they own scrolling, while herdr keeps host scrollback for panes that are behaving like a normal terminal transcript.
- Pane scrollbars now only appear when herdr has real host scrollback for that pane, instead of implying a host-managed scroll position for app-owned scrolling.

### Fixed
- Fixed Codex and pi panes becoming unscrollable in herdr by preserving recoverable host history for top-anchored normal-screen output, without relying on alternate-screen scrollback retention.
- Fixed pane wheel routing so apps using mouse reporting or alternate-scroll behavior can receive scroll input directly instead of having herdr always intercept it.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- Fixed pane scrollbars so they reserve their own lane instead of drawing over terminal content, which makes scrolling and scrollbar dragging behave more cleanly in narrow panes.
- Fixed alternate-screen scrollback handling so full-screen terminal apps can preserve recoverable history inside herdr panes instead of losing rows that scroll off.
- Fixed Codex in herdr panes losing transcript/history while running in alternate screen, so past output remains scrollable instead of disappearing as the session grows.
- Hid the rendered terminal cursor while a pane is scrolled back, avoiding stray cursor blocks appearing in the wrong place during history navigation.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- Herdr now checks for updates at startup and periodically while it stays open, so long-running sessions can still discover new releases without a restart cycle.
- Added a lightweight bottom-right toast when an update has been downloaded and is ready, with a simple restart-to-use-it flow.

### Changed
- Rendering is now driven more directly by app events instead of relying as much on polling, which makes the UI feel snappier and cuts unnecessary redraw work.

### Fixed
- Restored smooth fast spinner animation for working agents.
- Closing a pane or workspace now reliably terminates the processes running inside that pane session instead of leaving shells or child processes behind.
- Fixed bracketed paste handling so incomplete paste sequences are preserved across read timeouts instead of being dropped or misread.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- Added a local Unix socket API for controlling running herdr sessions, including workspace and pane management, pane reads, text/key input, pane splitting, and output waits.
- Added event subscriptions over the socket API for workspace and pane lifecycle events, pane output matches, and agent state changes.
- Added CLI wrappers on top of the socket API with `herdr workspace ...`, `herdr pane ...`, and `herdr wait ...`, using compact public ids like `1` and `1-2` for scripting and agent orchestration.
- Added a settings popup with mouse support for changing themes, sound alerts, and toast notifications from inside herdr.
- Added 9 built-in themes: catppuccin, tokyo night, dracula, nord, gruvbox, one dark, solarized, kanagawa, and rosé pine.
- Added interactive pane scrollbars, manual sidebar resizing, and upstream git ahead/behind indicators in the workspace sidebar.

### Changed
- Redesigned the sidebar into a two-section layout that separates workspace-level triage from per-agent detail, making it easier to supervise multiple agents in parallel.
- Agent state names exposed in the UI and integration surfaces now use `working` and `blocked`.
- Herdr now blocks nested launches by default when started inside a herdr-managed pane; set `advanced.allow_nested = true` to opt back in.

### Fixed
- Improved terminal keyboard protocol parsing and input forwarding across terminal variants, including better handling for shifted printable keys.
- Fixed Ghostty on macOS misparsing some arrow-key and modifier/enhanced key sequences.
- Refined sidebar rollups and pane ordering so workspace status and agent lists stay more stable and predictable.

### Documentation
- Refreshed the README, socket API reference, and reusable agent skill docs to better explain herdr's agent multiplexer model and integration surface.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- Added first-run onboarding flow that lets you choose notification preferences (sound and toast) on startup.
- Added optional visual toast notifications in the top-right corner for background workspace events (completion and attention-needed alerts).
- Added configurable keybindings for all navigate mode actions: new workspace, rename workspace, close workspace, resize mode, and toggle sidebar. See `CONFIGURATION.md` for the full key reference.
- Added configuration validation with startup diagnostics. Invalid key combinations or duplicate bindings now fall back to safe defaults with a visible warning.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Default prefix key changed from `ctrl+s` to `ctrl+b` to avoid common terminal flow control conflicts.
- Workspaces now derive their identity from the repository or folder of their root pane, updating automatically as you navigate. Custom names act as overrides rather than static labels.
- Sidebar now shows workspace numbers again in expanded view.
- Refined sidebar presentation with consistent marker/name/state ordering and comma-separated agent summaries.
- Keybinding parser now accepts special keys (`enter`, `esc`, `tab`, `backspace`, `space`) and function keys (`f1`–`f12`).

### Documentation
- Split configuration reference into a dedicated `CONFIGURATION.md` file with full keybinding documentation and config diagnostics explanation.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- Added optional sound notifications for agent state changes, including a completion chime when background work finishes and an alert when an agent needs input.
- Added per-agent sound overrides under `[ui.sound.agents]`, so you can mute or enable notifications by agent instead of using one global setting. Droid notifications are muted by default.

### Changed
- Request alerts now play even when the agent is in the active workspace, while completion sounds remain limited to background workspaces.

### Fixed
- Improved foreground job detection on Linux and macOS so herdr can recognize agents that run through wrapper processes or generic runtimes, including cases like Codex running under `node`.
- Made Claude Code state detection more stable by handling more spinner variants and smoothing short busy/idle flicker during screen updates.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- Initial release.
